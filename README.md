TASK_1 : Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Overview:
This project was undertaken during my internship at CodSoft, where I successfully completed my first task - Titanic Survival Prediction. The goal was to leverage Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict passenger survival outcomes based on the famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.
Task Accomplishment:
Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries in Python to derive insights, visualize data, and identify correlations, survival patterns, and class distributions.
Feature Engineering: 
Introduced new features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Machine Learning Model: 
Trained and tested a Logistic Regression model with outstanding accuracy in predicting the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers.

TASK_2 : MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model to forecast the ratings of movies. By analyzing historical movie data, this model utilizes regression techniques to estimate ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. The project encompasses multiple stages:
--Data Preprocessing
--Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
--Feature Engineering
--Model Development, Training, and Testing
--Model Prediction Using Visualized Charts
Key Analyses and Visualizations:
--Top Ten Highest-Rated Movies
--Contrast of Rating and Votes
--Top 10 Actors
--Pair Plot
--Correlation Heatmap
--Unique Values of Genre

TASK_3 : IRIS Flower Classification

Overview:
The Iris flower dataset includes data on three species of Iris flowers. Each species has unique measurements for their sepals and petals, and these measurements form the basis of this classification challenge. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on these features.
Dataset:
The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is often used for training and testing in the field of data science.
The dataset contains 150 observations of Iris flowers. There are four features representing the physical dimensions:
--Sepal length in cm
--Sepal width in cm
--Petal length in cm
--Petal width in cm
Along with the species label:
Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
The selected model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying the Iris species, making it a reliable tool for predictive analysis in this context.

TASK_4 : Sales Prediction Using Python

This project is focused on forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase. Our approach considers a variety of factors including advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data for informed decision-making in advertising, optimizing strategies to maximize sales potential.
Features:
--Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare your sales data for analysis.
--Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain insights from the data with visualization and statistical methods.
--Model Training: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict sales.
--Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
--Optimization: Fine-tune the model for better accuracy and efficiency.
