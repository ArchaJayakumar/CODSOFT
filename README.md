Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Overview:
This project was undertaken during my internship at CodSoft, where I successfully completed my first task - Titanic Survival Prediction. The goal was to leverage Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict passenger survival outcomes based on the famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.

Task Accomplishment:
Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries in Python to derive insights, visualize data, and identify correlations, survival patterns, and class distributions.

Feature Engineering: 
Introduced new features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Model: 
Trained and tested a Logistic Regression model with outstanding accuracy in predicting the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers.
